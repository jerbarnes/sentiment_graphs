Horrible experience !
The learning groups mentioned by others are a nightmare if you end up with other members who show up at the 11th hour asking what they should do to contribute to a project that's been in the works for 4 weeks .
I had unresponsive teachers including one who praised participants for the wallpaper they used in their postings but ignored the content .
Extreme negative reviews of two classes including contact info to discuss were ignored by the administration .
In my view the sole purpose of this institution is to collect ( exorbitant ) tuition .
I am a Ph.D student in the school of education with an emphasis in teaching and learning at Capella .
I am in my dissertation , having completed some very extensive work in each course ( including much effort in my research papers for each class and very difficult comps , both written and oral)I have found the coursework , comps , and colloquia very rewarding and challenging .
Anyone wanting to just sit through a degree without having to get involved can attend any traditional institution , but with Capella and her sister school Univ .
of Phoenix , one has to be involved in a continuous manner , as every learner has to complete the very extensive research papers , to accomplish what face-to-face traditional institutions do not do .
I have attend both , and will never attend a traditional institution again .
Online and Capella are definitely for those requiring a quality learning experience .
I have just finished an Associates in Accounting degree and am currently in my first class in the Bachelor's in Information Technology degree track .
I have to agree with GoCryToYOurMommyDontCryHere .
The people who are whining about UoP being the worst school ever are the ones who didn't finish , which is obvious .
The ones who talk about get swindled or hoodwinked with FAFSA and scholarship loans are probably the ones with sub-prime mortgages that have begun ballooning and they're probably whining about how they were hoodwinked into those as well .
It's always somebody else's fault and they're not afraid to shout it out to the world .
The ones who complain about UoP costing so much obviously never went to college anywhere before this .
Here's a clue folks , it's not any cheaper at a university .
Do you think UoP is in it for the joy ?
It's a for-profit organization . . .
If you are serious about going to school and getting an education , but don't want to add the extra commitment of being somewhere at a given time to attend classes , UoP fits the bill .
I can come home and work in the evenings and weekends and not have to worry about being somewhere to attend class for three hours at a crack .
The classes offer real education and learning , but to get the most out of them you have to do the work .
In the 20+ classes I've taken so far , no matter how elementary I thought they were at the beginning , I always came away having learned something new .
Instructors vary in quality , but most are hard-working and want to help you succeed .
The ones that aren't get weeded out fairly quickly .
UoP allows anyone who wants to pay them to attend , so a diverse group of people will enroll .
Some will be shocked by the work they will have to do in class and soon you'll be hearing from them in this forum .
Only two or three per class will have the organization and determination to do well .
Most every person who does enroll will have sub-standard writing abilities , some because they never learned , and some because they got lazy over the years .
The ones who stay will sharpen those skills and become more polished in their thinking and their writing .
Bottom line : It's not cheap , but then you're paying for an extensive infrastructure built to deliver education to you wherever you go .
Don't expect to have your hand held just because you're paying money for the class .
The purpose of school is to learn , and that has to come from within .
Maybe not everyone has had a bad experience with DeVry but I can give you two examples of why NOT to go there .
1 .
Mismanaged financial aid .
They have this wonderful EduCard program they try to sell you the problem in my experience is they got it wrong .
They set it too low and I wasn't aware of it until I got nasty emails threatening probation .
Keep in mind no one had called me about this and *I* was not the one who set the paperwork to make it too low , they did .
I finally was able to cover the difference with a private loan and I thought I was golden .
That was until my last session with DeVry and they sent back my entire disbursement rather than use part of it to pay my balance thus leaving me in debt with them and no way to pay it .
I have tried for 3 weeks now to get straight answers as to why private funds were returned and I have been ran around the block more times than a runner at the Boston Marathon .
They changed the due date of my huge debt 3 times in the meantime and I am still awaiting documentation as to why they decided not to use any of my private loan to pay for my education , funny I thought that's why I had gotten one !
2 .
Teacher quality could be vastly improved .
My last two classes were the absolute worst for teacher quality .
One teacher cut and paste the same comments repeatedly for everything , I often wondered if he actually read anything or just skimmed it and giving a grade .
Granted I don't expect a real life education but some level of interactiveness with the staff doesn't hurt .
The other teacher was even worse in fact any time you contacted him you'd wait over a week to hear back .
Work was graded very slowly in fact I was doing the final before the last two weeks had been completed which only hurts me , the student , in the end because I can't review it .
The instructor also couldn't spell or write effectively which was a major turn-off to his qualifications .
I had a programming class with no lectures which is always fun for beginners to try to learn concepts without any sort of interactivity .
With DeVry you get high cost and not much in return .
Most online institutions are considered diploma factories for a good reason because frankly they don't care if you are actually learning as long as they get their money .
The staff is nice enough but there doesn't appear to be much of a process for quality control at this school .
Another thing worth noting is at DeVry many times you will never see what you get on your finals because the instructors are NOT required to post them in your grade book .
There were many classes I knew my course grade but I never could go see how I did on my final which is something that is important to me .
After dealing with their finance dept .
more times than I'd care to remember spend your money elsewhere , the headache isn't worth it .
This college is the worst thing that has ever happened to education .
It is taking advantage of the poor .
Poor enter the school with hopes of earning a degree to get them better jobs and pay federal monies for it .
This college robs them of the chance by convincing them they are accomplishing something while it promotes cheating and nonperformance .
These people have to pay this money back some day and probably won't be able to get jobs to do it or be able to live due to high expense of paying the government back .
This college should be stopped before they cause bigger debts for the government to have to get out of as well as turning out uneducated people with diplomas that mean NOTHING>
I am a MBA student with 3 classes left .
UOP teachers basically grade very easy and there are no tests .
There are team papers for about 1/2 of the assignments and most of the students I worked with...I wonder how they graduated from high school .
Papers are supposed to be written in APA format and many do not even know how to properly cite a reference .
Basically an easy " A " and every class .
It is a total joke of a school .
You can learn ( teach yourself ) but you do not learn much from the students .
Most do not read the weekly chapters and have little to add to discussions .
There must be some kind of incentive for the teachers to give As .
I took accounting and was lost through out most of the course because I found it difficult to teach it to myself .
I got an A . Ridiculous .
I am embarassed I go to UOP , but I came this far , I am going to finish .
Good thing I work for the government...they take a degree for anywhere .
I highly do NOT recommend UOP .
Hello . . . First , I am a Capella PhD student who is about done ! !
My dissertation is currently in the committee approval and is about to be turned into the school for approval !
With that said...for those who are questioning the validity of Capella , you will have to make your own mind up , but from my experience...it is no joke .
I have felt like giving up before , but the school of B and Tkept pushing me .
The dissertation process was the hardest thing that I have ever done , mentally ( and I have done several demanding tasks in the US Army ) .
It wasn't hard from the " Capella sucks " mindset...but from the " you can't just walk in there , pay your money , and get your degree " mindset .
For those who have that mindset about Capella , you need to be put away for insanity ( or for frivolous motivations ) .
Do I ever feel that I have to defend my degree ( or soon to be degree ) ?
Sure .
Why ?
Because all of the nut jobs out that that have zero clue what distance education is about and their failures on life in general .
I , like I said , am a veteran .
Mom and dad couldn't pony up for me to go off to school right out of HS ( not that there is anything wrong with that just making a point ) .
When I got out of the Army , I had started a family and a career , so the act of going to school ( even part time ) was hard .
But I did it with my BS and MS .
Something that I have learned about these people with pessimism towards Capella is that they are on tilt , have had their " wittle " feelings hurt by the process , or just are down right mad/ jealous that there are other options than the traditional B and M route ( of which my BS and MS are from B and M schools ) .
With all that praise said , and to show my non-partisanship towards Capella , I will state that I feel they over advertise on mediums such as the Internet , which brings down the " shine " in a sense .
Also , they do need to start putting forth some more stringent standards on acceptance...i.e...GMAT scores , etc .
AND of course the cost...it isnt cheap !
Just MHO .
Oh...almost forget....for the " Einstein " that made the idiotic remark that people that go/ graduate from Capella have no real world experience . . .
Dude , get a clue !
I have active duty military experience , collegiate teaching experience , and over 10 years of professional IT experience .
You can take your foot out of your mouth at any time : )
Well after reading most of the comments here , I will say that I am even more afraid to start " UOP " as everyone here is calling it .
I don't have any degree's just a high school diploma but have been fortunate enough throuout my work years to have really great jobs with high incomes and still have one of those jobs today .
But for my own personal reason's I really want to go back to school and receive a degree .
I've been speaking with this one counselor for several month's now from UOP and he calls me once or twice a week to know if I am still going to enroll in the classes for " Associate of Arts in Business " ?
I tell him yes but inside I am saying ? ? ? ? ? ? because I have been burned before by a so called " training school " that made several promises for the job market today in the Medical Field with hard work and your diploma/certificate .
But I got nothing in the end , but smart mouth teacher's , a letter to pay for my own Graduation and a bill to receive my Diploma .
Thank God I got I already had a great job at Kaiser Permanente Medical Facility , because without my own great attitute , common sense , self motivation and hard work , I dought if that school would have helped me and I just don't want to go through it again .
Don't get me wrong , I know that some things and places are what you make it but If I am paying for it , I want it to pay off , and not just get the money and run .
Quick story in regards to the school I went to for that Medical Diploma , while on my job at the Hospital , I decided to tell the school that I needed them to fax over my resume for a position at the Hospital without letting them know I already worked there .
Because this was one of the schools requirements to help the students find medical positions , well can you believe that the school faxed over 35 resumes of other students and not one was mine .
Can you believe that ?
and I still owe Citibank student loans today .
Now who wants to get burned again ? ?
I am working with an advisor for CTU and she is really friendly and non pushy .
I wanted to start classes May 23 but she wanted me to wait until the start date in July so my paperwork work for finacial aid does not have to be rushed and I can see where I stand with aid .
I also had problems accessing one of the webpages Friday night after 10:00pm an she connected me to technical support to esolve the issue .
The technician even helped me walk thru the application to make sure I did not have any more technical issues .
I just sent them transcipt request forms .
I will wait and see what classes they accept and if not enough i will not sign up for classes but so far I have had a very positive experience .
I can call and talk to someone 24 hours a day and reach techincal support regarding ANY online issue 24 hours a day .
There online program has alot of featurs as well .
I find it hard to believe all the negative issues with the advisors .
I could call her now and talk to her if i like and she answers all my email within 5 minutes when she works from 5pm to 5am central time .
I am currently working on my Masters in Human Services ( General ) .
Great school , great education .
I want to get my PHD as well through them .
I had a 3.64 GPA and other options .
Why the negative vibe by some ?
I have read all of you alls previous post and I can't ascertain so many negative responses .
I just completed my first graduate class - MGMT 610 ( The Manager in a Technological Society ) , instructed by Dr . George Ellis and TA , Dr . Patricia McKenna .
This course was challenging , up-to-date , and the text by Daft and Mann complimented the course brilliantly .
I worked very intensely for the A I received .
Dr . Ellis gave wonderful replies and critiques to assignments that were submitted in reference to the assigned work .
My chosen discipline and objective is a M.S . in Human Resource Mangement .
I really learned a plethora of strategies , structures , and approaches businesses , non-profit , and public sectors use , which fostered a better understanding of the way corporations operate .
Perhaps , you disgruntled students are missing the point all together .
The University is an open enrollment University , which will attract derelicts and people that seem incapable of academic success .
Look at it this way , if a University such as UMUC did not admit certain people , would a chance be given to them otherwise ?
I look at it like this , as long as the college is accredited , I could care less how easy it is because I can sale myself in the interview for a position once I complete my chosen degree .
I bet you all don't have good interview skills to sale yourself .
So , you have to rely on a school name to get you hired , what a shame .
I can make a penny seem like a fortune .
I just need to attain a master's to open doors that would have otherwise been closed , an accredited degree which UMUC offers , will work just fine .
UMUC has a pretty good reputation from other post I have read .
There are mixed reviews from students that have attended UMUC .
All I know is , the first class I took I liked and want to continue at UMUC because the quality of my degree discipline has been good and proven commendable so far .
Let me ask you all this , If UMUC was " too easy " and the students and staff were beneath your abilities , why didn't you transfer real quick ?
Do you all know something I don't ?
When people attain a degree from UMUC can they not get a career ?
That's all I need to know .
If individual's can't find work by obtaining a degree at UMUC , I am definitely in the wrong place , other than that i'm straight .
Reply please , let me know if folks don't advance or find jobs upon attaining a UMUC degree .
I am in Technical Mgmt at DuPage campus ; Illinois .No matter what you say Devry is a great school .
Yes it is expensive , but you get what you pay for . . .
I highly recommend DeVry ! ! !
Great school , excellent and thought provoking environment .
Courses are rigorous and challenging .
I assume your ive is to make money in a field that interests you .
Perceptions count ; you must have something an employer wants , and he must know he wants it .
If you want to make money and be accepted among your peers , your should be to graduate from a school with a football team rather than an unheard of school like the DEVRYs of this world .
Public institutions get free advertising almost every night on the local news/sports casts .
So you get built in name recognition of your school .
Employers in your state are more likely to support ( help fund ) the public institutions of your state because they serve as incubators for the next generation of their employees .
Their managers are more likely to be Alums of a Public Institutions ( get the good old boy network on your side ) If you are a High school student work hard to make yourself eligible for your states public university or college .
If you are a recent graduate and cant get into a public college go to your local community college .
My bet is that an associates degree from a community college is just as marketable as an associates degree from a private specialty school .
( Did I mention that it is less expensive too ? ) Some ( dare I say most ? ) community colleges have extension classes that allow you to gain transferable credits to a state 4 year institution .
Lastly if none of these options meet your needs ( I think you should re-evaluate your needs but ! ) by all means check out a private school such as DEVRY .
What makes my opinion any better or worse than those others posted on this site ?
Well , lets see I am a 95 , DEVRY graduate of the Phoenix , AZ . USA , BSEET curriculum .
I am also a Retired Naval officer worked in the electronics field for 39 years now as a technician .
As an officer I have had some management experience and have associated with other managers so I understand how they think .
Much is made of DEVRYs , mainly by DEVRY , heavily hands-on focus .
As a manager hiring an engineer , I would be more interested in depth of knowledge and understanding of the principles of engineering and science , and the ability to bring those principles to bear on problem solving rather than the ability to actually build the device .
I have others , usually titled Technicians , to which I assign the duties of fabrication and testing .
Lastly : I havent looked at DEVRYs curriculum in years .
I found it to be pretty easy .
It was thorough but it didnt tax my military electronics training too much .
That may be because a BSEET degree is not an engineering degree .
It is a Technician Degree .
BS EETs generally serve as engineering technicians not engineers .
That is left to those who have years of experience and or those with a minimum of a BSEE degree .
I can not say that I have experienced the issues outlined by rootcrontab .
Connectivity has not been an issue .
University of Pheonix Online has provided a reliable classroom environment .
The material is challenging and learning environment is unique .
I am pleased with my overall experience with UOP . ------------------------------ To SEANOS : I am entering my final class for my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems with UOP .
The experience has been a positive one .
The environment is certainly different from an actual classroom in that most , if not all , communication is conducted online .
Many will argue that you miss out on the social interaction .
I say that by the time you reach college , your social skills should already be developed and the focus should be on training you can actually use .
In this day and age computer skills and the ability to communicate using the technology available is a necessity in the corporate world .
UOP provides a solid education and forces students to develop a sound understanding of computer technologies .
I am a firm believer in UOP and online learning .
Dont be fooled by what others may claim .
Online learning is not a cakewalk .
It takes hardwork and focus to stay on course but the results are extremely rewarding .
I have been attending UOP for nearly two years , things apparently came to an end because the inability to handle issues in a timely manner .
My financial counselor and her manager dropped the ball , when I called to speak with another manager or director they put me on hold for 25 minutes which was convenient for them because at that point it was after 5:00 pm MT .
My financial counselor is a liar and her manager is a coward .
Over time I have been experiencing issues with many of the faculty , their feedback ( individual ) came during the last week of class , they were unresponsive or they didnt know the material .
I honestly have to say that UOP is in it for the money rather than the success of their students .
I am considering a phd in criminal justice at Capella .
I live in Georgia and currently , there is no PhD program for cj in the state .
I am in law enforcement and work nightshift , so the flexibility appeals greatly .
I do have my B.S . and my M.S . from brick and mortar schools .
I am also looking at a PhD at a brick and mortar , but it is not in criminal justice ; I would only have a cognate in criminal justice .
I would like to teach eventually , and I am not picky as to whether it is a two year college or a well known brick and mortar .
Any help would be greatly appreciated , whether it is good or bad .
UoP sucks ! ! ! ! !
They get your money and then screw you out of a real education .
I made straight A's at UoP but the instructors I had for all my classes gave no feed back , no weekly grades(so you had no idea if you was actually learning the material correctly or not ) and financial couslor was a joke !
She would not return phone calls or emails .
This college lacks too much to risk your hard earned money...find another college and seriously research them before joining ! ! To stanford : I made straight A's at UoP . . UoP's biggest problem is they are too big , hire instructors with full plates already to instruct , and lack financial aide that helps with book costs .
Their program for financial aide is screwed up ! ! ! AND I bet since you work at a hospital...you get employer repayment or at least half your tutition paid .
A lot of people who haven't had the problems MOST of us have had....they were not fitting the entire bill therefore had no worries .
But US who pay and work hard to get an education do find we expect MORE from a college whether online or not .
I took on UoP knowing full well the work load would be heavy , but it was going to be well worth it for accomplishing my goals .
So please do not say I or others did not have the abilities to complete our education .
To UpsetStudent : I do agree with you . . UoP only sees potential students as $$$$$ and their programs stink ! ! Force you to take classes that do not need to be taken for you field .
The University of Phoenix online is a joke .
Returning students who need an online program should do everything in their power to find a different school .
It's an exception to find a UOP instructor who is fully competent .
Standards between " facilitators " ( they don't like to call them instructors or professors at UOP ) are practically non-existent .
Class syllabuses are dictated by the University , and instructors frequently use this as an excuse for a poor class .
The " Learning Team " element ( which is intrinsic to every class and accounts for 40-60% of your grade ) is nothing by a crapshoot .
If you are a good student , you will usually ( not always , but usually ) doing 80-100% of the " team " assignments yourself if care about getting an A in the class .
Online quizzes and tests are often very badly written , and I have yet to have a single instructor who was willing to say " yeah , that wasn't the best way to ask that question . "
Unlike all modern universities , there is no way to get feedback on an instructor before you are financially committed to the class .
Unlike normal universities , you don't even get a choice of instructors -- the instructor is assigned the day before your class starts .
Once you make even a single post to the class newsgroup you are financially committed to that class ( I don't know if this is rigidly enforced ) .
Bottom line : there are a lot of online degree programs available now -- don't waste you time and money with UOP .
And , BTW , just in case you think this is a " sour grapes " rant -- I'm less than a year away from my degree and still have a 4.0 GPA .
This is just flat out a bad school .
I wish I'd never started the program .
I thought Devry was great !
I especially saw a difference when I had to go looking for a new job in the past month .
Had an offer for $12k more than I made in my last job .
Big difference from when I didn't have my degree .
The professors were excellent as well the financial aid office .
On a two year sabbatical , I had to pay back my loan from Devry .
The financial aid person was excellent and by far the best credit person I've ever dealt with .
I would do it over in a heartbeat .
As a matter of fact , I'm currently attending Keller in Phx for my MISM and have been impressed .
It is amazing the comments about a univesity .
I could go to a local college and get a poor education also just from a lack of effort .
That would seem to fit any of these people .
You only get out what you put in .
I am curious though , how many of you folks that got out of this college went on to another college and got your degree ?
anyone ?
Yep , sure is easy to complain though .
CTU has a north central regional accreditation , but I suppose you know better that the accreditation board ?
Sure you do . . . . .
Try this , enroll in a brick and mortar , get your degree and then come back and tell me what a lousy school it is because at least I know you tried to better yourself .
I am halfway through my program and my wages have gone up by $10,000 already .
Why , because I spend the time to learn and not get spoonfed like some of my buddies who went to brick and mortar schools .
Have fun with your life I am sure you will find plenty to bitch about as time passes you by....without any degrees !
Thank you for your attention .
Student of CTUOnline .
( with a regional accreditaion and soon to offer PE courses , not bad for a terrible college huh ? )
I recieved my Bachelors in Software Engineering last fall .
Never opened a single book they sent me and they were never even referenced by instructors .
In fact , half the time the instructors told us to disregard them .
I graduated with a 3.79 GPA .
I don't feel I really learned all that much as every assignment I did was done with info off the net and I probably only listened to half a dozen chats .
Chats tended to be worthless drivel of some instructor simply reading out of a book or off slides .
I've had to go back and use the books I was sent and complete the projects in them on my own time to truly feel that I earned the degree on my wall .
Its an easy A no matter what you are told , but if you really put effort into it you can learn .
It's just sad that you can't get the degree for a whole lot less money .
For the sake of time - I will not comment on quality of education - let's assume it is OK compared to it's competitors .
The adminstration of the school needs to get fired .
The programs change frequently and these changes are not understood by the staff of the school leaving the learner to pay tuition while these items get sorted out .
The school has no interest in customer satisfaction and does a superior job of recrutiment - but makes no committment to it's current learners who are often left to sort out the schools issues and pay ridiculous amounts of tuition .
The school never admits fault - desipte its frequent unorganization .
Considering it has a business school - it is one of the most poorly run business I have ever been associated with .
I would not recommend Capella to ANYONE .
There are better institutions out there .
What is UMUC's point in Europe ?
I surveyed the courses that start on Monday 23 AUG , and found many canceled , 1/3 to 2/3 at Army posts canceled or remain pending , while at Ramstein and Spang more are marked as'Go .
Some posts have no courses marked 'Go' .
Further , what is the point of a UMUC brochure listing courses , when they don't offer many new courses , or only a fraction of those listed in the brochure .
It's the same courses , and the same professors adding little new to what they said last year , or the year before .
It's the same planners in Heidelberg too .
They say if you don't like what they offer go to DE . That's not a helpful solution .
Nothing against DE for thoe who want it , but I'd like a classroom learning experience .
I think both Army and Air Force folks here in Europe want better from the planners in Heidelberg ( who probably should retire to make wayfor more innovative management ) .
That's what people say here , and even the local ESO agrees .
Get with it UMUC .
You make a lot of money off of us , so start giving back some quality .
And , by the way , the Army needs to get over the eArmy thing .
Like UMUC , eArmy too seems like such a scam .
I am currently going to DeVry .
I went to a state college like some of the posters said is better this was in FL .
I left the school 1 semester away from my Associate's degree because the education was so horrible .
I already knew most of the stuff before the classes began , most classes I did not even have to open the book and I got an A . I left there with a 3.90 GPA .
Besides some pain in the butt financial aid issues that were resolved my education at DeVry has been great .
I was really worried about going there because of how much bashing the school takes .
The classes I have taken are actually challenging , the teachers know a lot more than the teachers at my previous college .
I know someone posted something about throwing out applications that have a school where you only go 2 years for a Bachelors degree .
I'm not sure where this person was so seriously misinformed , but going full time it takes 3 1/2 years , so that is a whole 6 months less than a traditional college .
We do have 8 week terms instead of 12 weeks , but that does not mean that we do less work .
It is the same amount of work just a shorter time frame .
I learn more in an 8 week class at DeVry than probably my whole wasted education at my previous college .
Are they the greatest college out there ?
Of course not .
But they do over a great education my classes have been challenging and the teachers educated .
I go online so I cannot say about any of the locations .
So do not believe that the traditional college is so much better and DeVry is a scam .
I have went to a traditional college and friends that went to them and what I have learned at DeVry is much more advanced than any of those other colleges .
Again it is not the best school , but neither are all of the traditional colleges , and the ones that are really good are also hard to get into .
I was suckered by a traditional college that did nothing to prepare me for the field I was studying ; DeVry on the other hand is actually preparing me for my intended field as well as educating me on other aspects meaning there is more than one field I could go into .
It is kind of overpriced , but it's still a great education and it cost only a little more than the traditional college that I wasted almost 2 years of my life at .
I actually had a class on Macromedia Flash , yeah now Adobe where I knew more than the teacher and I taught her a whole bunch of stuff about the application and I answered all of the students classes .
So yeah traditional colleges look great on paper , just don't expect to learn too much .
